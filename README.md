# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
This is the course project of the Getting and Cleaning Data course which does the following:
    
	1. Takes all the data from a folder in your working directory
	
    2. Creates two data frames called "test" and "train"
    
	3. Merges the "train" and the "test" data frames to create one data frame.
    
	4. In the recent data frame extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    
	5. Shows activity names and variables descriptively in the data frame.
    
	6. Creates another tidy data frame with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 
    You could see the result in the TidyData.txt file.
